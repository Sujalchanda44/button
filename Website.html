      My story is very intanse hold your tears.<br>
      I am from a humble background i lost<br> 
      my father at very young age <br>
      also I was not  a good student in my earlier years<br>
      and I bearly solve any math problem and can't remember a <br>
      sentance properly. I would say that i was a very avearge student.<br>
      I was too deamed and lack condidence at my teenage and was super shy<br>
      I spend lot of my time playing games and scrolling internet at that time.<br>
      I rearly went out to play and was too lazy to do something.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Then in IX th standard I met sir HUSSIAn who was my math teacher at that time <br>
      he came in my life as a hero and change everything what is going wrong in my life <br>
      I literlly sucked at math can't solve a simple division by myself <br>
      Then, he came and taugt me every basic math required to slove mnd made math one of my strong subject<br>
      I would be happy to say that i scored 99/100 in Math in HSLC.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Now, I was in senior year and i choose SCIENCE as my strean and thought to persue Engineering <br>
      in my 12th i was a ok-ok student somehow passed every subject but not a topper.<br>
